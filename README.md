## Description 
I designed my own personal portfolio. It contains an avitar picture, information of myself, projects/future projects, and my contact info. I plan to build onto this portfolio as time goes on.  

## Learning Points 
I learned how to organize a website by designing my layout in boxes. After adding my basic HTML & CSS code, I learned how to inspect it and test adjustments during inspection. I worked a lot with flex and learned how to align my design. Finally I was able to understand @media Rule.
